<h1>Python Iterators</h1>
<p>An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values. Also, it is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can take each value within it and apply somethig to it. </p>
<h2>Iterators vs Iterable</h2>
<p>Lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets are all <b>iterable objects</b>. They are iterable <i>containers</i> which you can get an iterator from.</p>
<code><pre>
    mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cheery") # Thats iterable object
    apple  #  Thats an iterator
    banana #  Thats an iterator
    cherry #  Thats an iterator 
</pre></code>
<p>Even strings are iterable objects.</p>
<pre><code>
    mystr = 'omega' # Thats iterable object
    o # Thats an iterator
    m # Thats an iterator
    e # Thats an iterator
    g # Thats an iterator
    a # Thats an iterator
</code></pre>
<h2>Looping through an Iterator</h2>
<p>We can use a <b>for</b> loop to iterate through an iterable object.</p>
<pre><code>
    mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

    for x in mytuple:
        print(x)
    
    apple 
    banana 
    cherry 
</code></pre>
<h2>Create an Iterator</h2>
<p>To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>__next__()</code> to your object.</p>
