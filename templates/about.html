        <p> Hi! My name is Borys and I am a beginner programmer. I started my journey at the beginning of 2020 with Python Developer course. Since then I am trying to expend my knowledge. I find it frustrating, hard and totally awesome.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a Python programmer you found him! Don't regret your decision, contact ME! </p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
