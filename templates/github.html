<h2>What is Git?</h2>
<p>It is a version control system (VCS) that is responisble for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. In order to better understand Git, we should explain it's uniqueness of how it thinks
    about data. Most other systems (eg.CVS,Subversion,Perforce,Bazaar) store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time. This is commonly
    known as "delta-based" version control.</p>

<p>Yet, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at the moment and stores a reference
    to that snapshot. In order to be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn't store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a STREAM OF SNAPSHOTS.</p>

<h2>Why should I like it?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. Therefore, you need no information from another computer on your network. Meaning?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>To browse the history of the project, Git reads it directly from your local database. It doesn't need to go out to the server to get it and then display it.</li>
        <li>There is very little you can't do if you're offline or off VPN.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Everything in Git is <a href="/usefull_terms/#checksum">checksummed</a> before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it's impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. The mechanism
        Git uses for this checksumming is called SHA-1.</li>
    <li>Nearly all actions ADD data to the database in Git. Therefore it is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Three States</h2>
<p>This is a very important part, so focus!</p>
<p>Git has three main states that your files can reside in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>MODIFIED, means that you have changed the file but have not commited it to your database yet.</li>
    <li>STAGED, means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</li>
    <li>COMMITTED, means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:</p>
<img src="{% static 'areas.png' %}">
<ul>
    <li>The WORKING TREE is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.</li>
    <li>The STAGING AREA is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.</li>
    <li>The GIT DIRECTORY is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most importnat part of Git, and it is what is copied when you <code>clone</code> a repository from another computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You modify files in your working tree.</li>
    <li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.</li>
    <li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, itâ€™s considered committed. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.</p>
